### Procedural vs. Object-Oriented Programming 

- The unit in procedural programming is funciton, and unit in OOP is class.
- Procedural programming concentrates on creating function, while OOP starts from isloating the classes, and then look for the methods inside them.
- Procedural programming sperates the data of the program from the operations that manipulate the data, while OOP focus on both of them.

### Concepts of Class and Object

- "Class" refers to a blueprint. It defines the variables and methods the object support.
- "Object" is an instance of a class. each object has a class which defines its data and behavior.

### Class Members

- A class can have three kinds of members:
  - **fields**: data variables which determine the status of the class or an object (e.g. )
  - **methos**: executable code of the class built from statemets. It allows us to manipulate/change the status of an object or access the value of the data member
  - **nested classes and nested interfaces**
