### Procedural vs. Object-Oriented Programming 

- The unit in procedural programming is funciton, and unit in OOP is class.
- Procedural programming concentrates on creating function, while OOP starts from isloating the classes, and then look for the methods inside them.
- Procedural programming sperates the data of the program from the operations that manipulate the data, while OOP focus on both of them.
